      <h2 style={styles.heading2}>7. Contests, Participation, and Prizes</h2>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The DREAMSPORT platform conducts various contests as part of the features offered by DREAMSPORT. These contests include fantasy cricket, football, kabaddi, volleyball, basketball, handball, hockey, baseball, rugby and US football. Participants in the contests create fantasy teams consisting of on-field players from the relevant match, series or tournament. Points are awarded based on the performance of these players and the user with the highest aggregate of points is declared winner of the contest. DREAMSPORT may declare more than one winner and distribute winnings accordingly in increasing order of their teams’ scores. The contests comply with the “Fantasy Rules” and other terms, conditions and regulations mentioned in the “How To Play” section.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        Users may participate in paid versions of the contests by paying a pre-defined entry fee, as stated on the relevant contest page. An individual is authorized to create multiple teams for participating in contests unless otherwise specified. In the case of multiple-entry contests, users may submit more than one team but are not allowed to edit their teams after the match deadline is closed. DREAMSPORT may limit the number of multiple teams allowed in a contest or the number of teams a single user account can create.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        DREAMSPORT is authorized to charge a predefined entry fee for accessing the features. However, residents of restricted states are not allowed to participate in paid versions of the contests.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        DREAMSPORT offers three variations in contests:
      </p>
      <ul style={styles.list}>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          <strong>Guaranteed Contests:</strong> As the name suggests, guaranteed contests offer guaranteed winnings and will not get cancelled, even if they do not meet the participant requirements/spots.
        </li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          <strong>Flexible Contests:</strong> In flexible contests, there should be at least 3 users and a maximum of 100 users in the contest. If there are two users in the flexible contest, the respective contest will be converted into head-to-head.

      <h2 style={styles.heading2}>8. Play Formats</h2>

      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The playing team information for live matches is sourced either from official sources or our experts but does not guarantee 100% accuracy. This information may be updated at any time.

      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>

        <li style={styles.listItem}>The total points you have in the contest will be calculated by adding up the points from all of your teams. If you have multiple teams, the points from each of them will be combined to give your overall total points in the contest. For instance, if you have three teams in the contest, the total points will be the sum of the points from all three teams (Team 1 + Team 2 + Team 3 = Total Points).</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>It is a requirement to pay an entry fee for every team that you participate with. The cost of the entry fee must be paid for each individual team that is registered. Please note that failure to pay the entry fee will result in the team being unable to participate in the contest.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>In the scenario of a tie for any rank, the winning amount will be shared equally among the players who are tied. This applies to any situation where multiple players have the same points, score or any other measurement used to determine the winner of a certain place.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>DREAMSPORT reserves the right to modify, suspend or cancel the contest, or the terms and conditions, at any time without liability. By entering the contest, users consent to the use of their personal information in accordance with the app’s privacy policy.</li>

      <h3 style={styles.heading3}>Private Contest:</h3>
      <ul style={styles.list}>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>DREAMSPORT offers private contests as another form of a contest on its platform, allowing Users to create contest(s) and invite friends or other DREAMSPORT users to compete.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>Private contests are pay-to-play contests with a minimum of 2 participants and a maximum of 50 participants. The minimum winning amount can be ₹20, and the maximum winning amount can be ₹50,000.

        <li style={styles.listItem}>The total winning amount in a private contest can be distributed among multiple winners, either manually defined by the User or automatically defined by DREAMSPORT. The User can choose between the two options while creating a private contest.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>Changes to the winning amount and number of participants are not allowed once a private contest is created, except for the name of the contest.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>To join a private contest, the invited User must provide the contest code and pay the contest entry fee. Private contests operate on a first-come, first-served basis and once the required number of participants is reached, no additional participants will be allowed.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>Private contests will not be cancelled even if the required number of participants is not reached, and winnings will be automatically recalculated based on the number of joined participants.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>In the automatic recalculation of winnings, winnings in decimal will be rounded off to the nearest whole number. If the winning amount ends in .5, it will be rounded off to the nearest whole number.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={styles.heading2}>10. Legality of Game of Skill</h2>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The legality of games of skill, such as those offered on fantasy sports platforms, has been established by Indian gambling legislation and court decisions. The Public Gambling Act of 1867 does not apply to games of skill and in 2020, the Haryana High Court dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by Ravindra Singh Chaudhary that questioned the legality of playing fantasy sports. The Court held that fantasy sports, as a game of skill where fees are paid to compete for prizes, are a legitimate business protected by Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right to engage in an occupation, trade or business.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The Contest/(s) offered as the features are considered games of skill as their outcome depends on the participant’s knowledge of the games of cricket, football, kabaddi, volleyball, basketball, hockey, handball, rugby, baseball, US football and players, their attention to the Contest and their ability to make strategic decisions. The success of participants depends on factors such as their knowledge of the statistics of the games, the form of the players and the conditions of the match. Participants are required to field well-balanced teams with available resources and make substitutions at appropriate times to earn maximum points.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        By participating in these Contest/(s), each Participant acknowledges and agrees that they are participating in a game of skill.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        More about the legality of DREAMSPORT can be found at the website of the All India Gaming Federation (AIGF): www.aigf.in. AIGF is the apex industry body for Online Skill Gaming in India. AIGF’s self-regulation charter for Online Skill Gaming is based on the principles of Transparency, Integrity and Responsible Gaming.

      <h3 style={styles.heading3}>26.2 TDS</h3>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        According to the new section 194BA of the Income-tax Act, 1961, starting from 1st April 2023, a 30% withholding tax (‘TDS’) will be applied to the positive “Net Winnings” earned by Users from online games on DREAMSPORT.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        TDS will be triggered:
      </p>
      <ul style={styles.list}>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>At the time of withdrawal throughout the year, or</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>At the end of the Financial Year i.e. 31st March</li>
      </ul>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        Net Winnings will be calculated using the following formula: In this case, Net Winnings of a User will be calculated as:
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        Net Winnings = A – B – C – D, where,<br />
        A = Aggregate withdrawals from the user account<br />
        B = Aggregate amount deposited in the user account during that period<br />
        C = Opening Balance in the user account at the beginning of the financial year (Winning + Unutilised Deposit)<br />
        D = Winnings included from earlier withdrawals on which TDS has already been deducted
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        For easier understanding, please refer to the following examples:
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        <strong>Example 1) TDS Deduction on 1st Withdrawal:</strong><br />
        A User has an opening wallet balance of ₹2,000 at the beginning of the financial/fiscal year and hasn’t deposited any amount in the DREAMSPORT wallet. The user uses the existing balance to participate in fantasy contests and has accumulated winnings of ₹10,000. Now the user requests a withdrawal of ₹4,000, then the User’s account has the following details:<br />
        Requested withdrawal from the user, A = ₹4,000<br />
        The amount deposited in the user account during the year, B = 0<br />
        Opening balance in the user account, C = ₹2,000<br />
        Winnings from earlier withdrawals on which TDS has been deducted, D = 0<br />
        Then, Net Winnings = A – B – C – D<br />
        Net Winnings = 4,000 – 0 – 2,000 – 0<br />
        Net Winnings = ₹2,000<br />
        TDS on this withdrawal will be calculated as follows:<br />
        TDS = 30% of Net Winnings<br />
        TDS = 0.30 * Net Winnings<br />
        TDS = 0.30 * 2,000<br />
        TDS = ₹600<br />
        Amount credited to Bank Account = Requested Withdrawal Amount (A) – TDS<br />
        Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹4,000 – ₹600<br />
        Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹3,400
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        In simpler terms, the User has requested to withdraw ₹4,000 from their winnings. After considering the account balance and deposits, the Net Winnings amount to ₹2,000. DREAMSPORT will withhold 30% of the Net Winnings as TDS, which is ₹600 in this case. The final amount credited to the User’s registered bank account would be ₹3,400.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        <strong>Example 2) TDS Deduction on Following Withdrawals:</strong><br />
        Let’s say that the same User has deposited ₹2,000 in their in-app wallet. The user now requests another withdrawal of ₹5,000. In this case:<br />
        Total withdrawal amount requested, A = ₹4,000 (earlier withdrawal amount) + ₹5,000 (new withdrawal amount)<br />
        Total amount deposited by the user, B = ₹2,000<br />
        Opening balance of the financial year, C = ₹2,000<br />
        Withdrawals on which TDS has been deducted, D = ₹2,000<br />
        Then, Net Winnings = A – B – C – D<br />
        Net Winnings = (₹4,000 + ₹5,000) – ₹2,000 – ₹2,000 – ₹2,000<br />
        Net Winnings = ₹9,000 – ₹6,000<br />
        Net Winnings = ₹3,000<br />
        TDS on this withdrawal will be calculated in the following manner,<br />
        TDS = 30% of Net Winnings<br />
        TDS = 0.30 * Net Winnings<br />
        TDS = 0.30 * 3,000<br />
        TDS = ₹900<br />
        Amount credited to Bank Account = Requested Withdrawal Amount – TDS<br />
        Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹5,000 – ₹900<br />
        Amount credited to Bank Account = ₹4,100
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The User has made two withdrawals that sum up to ₹9,000 from their winnings during the year. After considering the account balance, deposits and previous withdrawals, user’s Net Winnings amount to ₹3,000. After the TDS deduction, ₹4,100 will be credited to the registered bank account of the user.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        <strong>Example 3 TDS Deduction if the User Makes No Withdrawal Throughout the Year:</strong><br />
        Let’s suppose a User with an opening balance of ₹3,000, deposit of ₹5,000, winnings of ₹15,000 and unutilised deposit balance of ₹1,000, has not made any withdrawal throughout the year. In such case, Net Winnings and TDS deduction will be calculated in the following manner:<br />
        Net Winnings = E + A – B – C – D, where,<br />
        Total withdrawal amount, A = ₹0, as user hasn’t made any withdrawal request<br />
        Total amount deposited by the user, B = ₹5,000<br />
        Opening balance at the beginning of the financial year, C = ₹3,000<br />
        Winnings from earlier withdrawals on which TDS has already been deducted, D = ₹0, as no withdrawal has been made<br />
        Closing Balance at the end of the financial year (Winning + Unutilised Deposit), E = ₹15,000 + ₹1000 = ₹16,000<br />
        Net Winnings = E + A – B – C – D<br />
        Net Winnings = ₹16,000 + 0 – ₹5,000 – ₹3,000 – 0<br />
        Net Winnings = ₹16,000 – ₹8,000<br />
        Net Winnings = ₹8,000<br />
        TDS = 30% of Net Winnings<br />
        TDS = 0.30 * Net Winnings<br />
        TDS = 0.30 * 8,000<br />
        TDS = ₹2,400<br />
        New Closing Balance = Closing Balance in the user account at the end of the financial year – TDS<br />
        New Closing Balance = ₹16,000 – ₹2,400<br />
        New Closing Balance = ₹13,600
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        NOTE:
      </p>
      <ul style={styles.list}>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>This “new closing balance” of the year will automatically become the opening balance of the following financial year.</li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>TDS amount will be deducted first from your winning balance and, if required, then from your unutilised deposit balance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        As Cash Bonus(es) are a promotional incentive provided to the Users, they are exempted from TDS deduction.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The conversion feature doesn’t exempt winnings from taxes but offers a potential deferral of TDS liability as long as the converted amount remains deposited within the DREAMSPORT app for contest participation, or financial year ending (whichever happens earlier).
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The amount credited to the User’s registered bank account or DREAMSPORT Wallet (in case of a change in the financial year) will be the remaining amount after the TDS deduction, as per the new tax policy.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        In case of such tax deductions, the winners will be provided TDS certificates.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        In compliance with Section 269SU of the Income Tax Act, we insist on making payments by NEFT/RTGS/IMPS or any other E Modes.
      </p>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The individuals declared as winners by DREAMSPORT agree to pay any applicable taxes, including (but not limited to) income tax, gift tax, etc., in compliance with the new tax policy. Both winnings and DREAMSPORT Credits are subject to various taxes.

      <h1>Responsible Gaming for Fantasy Sports</h1>
      <p>
        At DreamSport, we are dedicated to ensuring that our users have a fun, safe, and balanced gaming experience. As part of our commitment to responsible gaming, we have implemented a strict policy to guide our users towards healthy gaming habits.

      <h2>Guidelines under "Responsible Gaming for Fantasy Sports"</h2>
      
      <h3>Skill-Based Activity</h3>
      <p>
        DreamSport's fantasy sports games are based on skill and strategic decision-making. While they are designed to be entertaining and rewarding, they should not be viewed as a reliable source of income.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Monitor Your Engagement</h3>
      <p>
        Be mindful of how much time you spend on our platform. Regularly assess your gaming activities to ensure they do not interfere with your personal or professional life.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Positive Gaming Attitude</h3>
      <p>
        Play with a positive mindset and for enjoyment. Avoid the temptation to continue playing with the aim of making up for previous losses.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Consultation and Support</h3>
      <p>
        Before committing significant time to gaming, consider discussing it with family or friends. Their insights can help you maintain a balanced approach to gaming.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Age Restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        Our services are only available to users who are 18 years or older. Please ensure that no minors access the platform through your account.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Proactive User Monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        We monitor user activities to identify potential issues. If we notice that your gaming patterns may be becoming problematic, we will contact you with advice and options to help you play responsibly.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Self-Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Regularly evaluate your gaming habits. If you feel that your gaming is affecting your daily life or well-being, consider taking a break or setting personal limits on your usage.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Balanced Gaming</h3>
      <p>
        Engage in fantasy sports as a fun pastime. Remember to balance your gaming with other daily activities and commitments to ensure a healthy lifestyle.
